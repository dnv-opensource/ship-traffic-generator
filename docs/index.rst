Welcome to Traffic Generator's documentation!
======================================

The tool generates a structured set of encounters for verifying automatic collision and 
grounding avoidance systems. Based on input parameters such as desired situation, relative speed, 
relative bearing etc, the tool will generate a set of traffic situations. The traffic situations 
may be written to files and/or inspected using plots.

A :download:`paper<../docs/ICMASS23_verfying_caga_systems.pdf>` is written describing the background for 
the tool and how it works.
